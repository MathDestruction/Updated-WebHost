# Updated-WebHost

Limitations:
- Lights cannot be toggled on and off (realtime lights)
- Looping audio that plays from start, seems to play even when device is locked or the web viewer is minimized

To Find/Figure out:
- Occlusion material
- Shadow catcher (Likley that no real time shadow catcher will be available)
